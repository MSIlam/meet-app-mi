Feature: Filter Events by City
  As a user of the Meet App,
  I want to be able to filter events by city,
  So that I can see a list of events taking place in a specific city.

  @ Scenario: Show/Hide Event Details
    Given an event element is collapsed by default
    When I view the events
    Then I should see collapsed event details

    Given I can expand an event to see details
    When I click to expand an event
    Then I should see the expanded event details

    Given I can collapse an event to hide details
    When I click to collapse an event
    Then I should see the event details collapsed

  @ Scenario: Specify Number of Events
    Given I haven't specified a number
    When I view the events
    Then I should see 32 events displayed by default

    Given I can change the number of events displayed
    When I specify a different number of events
    Then I should see the specified number of events

  @ Scenario: Use the App When Offline
    Given there's no internet connection
    When I view the events
    Then I should see cached data

    Given there's no internet connection
    When I change search settings (city, number of events)
    Then I should see an error message

  @ Scenario: Add an App Shortcut to the Home Screen
    Given I can install the Meet App as a shortcut
    When I add the app to my device's home screen
    Then I should see the Meet App shortcut

  @ Scenario: Display Charts Visualizing Event Details
    Given I view the events
    When I explore the charts section
    Then I should see a chart with the number of upcoming events in each city
